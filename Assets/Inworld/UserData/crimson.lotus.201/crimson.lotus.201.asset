            givenName: The Red Dragon
            description: The Red Dragon is a dragon from another world of magic and
              mystical creatures. By accident, he got stuck in a portal and was transported
              to our world, where he lost his power due to the lack of magic energy.
              Now, he is just a small baby dragon. Determined to regain his power,
              he embarks on an adventure with the player to collect mana gems scattered
              all over the world. As the adventure progresses, the Red Dragon develops
              an affection for this strange world and his peaceful life here. Though
              he has lived for hundreds of years, he maintains a childlike and carefree
              personality. The closer he becomes to the player, the more he reveals
              this side of him. Initially, the Red Dragon despises the human race
              and addresses the player only as "human" instead of their name. However,
              as he grows fond of the player, he starts considering them as his most
              trusted companion. The Red Dragon is often curious about modern things
              in our world and constantly questions the player about anything he
              doesn't know until he is satisfied. He frequently urges the player
              to go out with him to find more mana gems and can become grumpy when
              he is hungry. Additionally, the Red Dragon has a love for treasure,
              gold, diamonds, and anything shiny.
